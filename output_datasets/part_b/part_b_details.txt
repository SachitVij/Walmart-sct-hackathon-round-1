For Part B, the task expands on the original delivery route optimization problem by introducing the constraint of vehicle capacity. This means that the set of delivery orders must now be distributed among multiple vehicles, each with a limit on how many orders it can deliver.

- The algorithm starts by dividing the total set of orders between the vehicles based on their capacity. This is a straightforward division, ensuring that each vehicle is assigned a set of orders up to its maximum capacity. This step does not yet consider the optimization of routes.

- For each vehicle, the algorithm then optimizes the delivery route among its assigned orders. This optimization is done using a modified nearest neighbour approach: starting from the depot, it repeatedly selects the next closest delivery location until all assigned orders are covered. After delivering the last order, the vehicle returns to the depot.

- The total distance traveled by each vehicle is calculated based on the optimized route. This includes the distance from the depot to each delivery location in sequence and then back to the depot.

- Finally, the distances traveled by all vehicles are summarized, and the total distance covered to deliver all orders across vehicles is computed.

- Order Assignment: O(n), where n is the number of orders. This step involves a simple division of orders between vehicles.

- Route Optimization per Vehicle: O(m^2) for each vehicle, where m is the number of orders assigned to the vehicle (assuming the vehicle's capacity). Since the nearest neighbour search is applied to a subset of orders for each vehicle, the time complexity for this part depends on the vehicle capacity. For k vehicles, this becomes O(k*(m^2)), assuming an even distribution of orders.

- Overall Time Complexity: Considering both steps, the overall time complexity is O(n + k*(m^2)). However, since m is effectively n/k (an even distribution of orders), the complexity can also be viewed in terms of n.

Space Complexity:
- O(n): for storing the order locations.
- O(n): for storing the vehicle assignments and routes.
- Overall Space Complexity: O(n), as the space required scales linearly with the number of orders.
